# Third-party notices (head-tracked spatial audio work)

The experimental Shizuku-based head-tracking bridge (`android/core/.../privileged/`, the
Head Gestures toggle, and the Diagnostics screen) builds on the following work.

## fengkaobanli/O-Pose (MIT)

https://github.com/fengkaobanli/O-Pose

The 170-byte HID Sensor-page report descriptor used by `UhidHeadTracker.kt`, the virtual
device's vendor/product identity and the 14-byte input report layout
were read from the prebuilt `vtracker3` binary shipped in that project, which proved on a
OnePlus device that Android's Spatializer accepts a virtual HID head tracker. The descriptor
bytes are therefore derived from MIT-licensed work. Two deliberate deviations: we use the
standard AOSP identity strings and a spec-range report interval (10-100 ms) instead of theirs,
and we run the uhid device in-process in a Shizuku UserService (Binder) instead of a separate
native binary fed over a localhost socket.

## Android Open Source Project - Head Tracker HID Protocol

https://source.android.com/docs/core/sensors/head-tracker-hid-protocol

The report layout, the `#AndroidHeadTracker#1.0` sensor description, the Bluetooth persistent
unique ID scheme, the report-interval range and the angular-velocity scaling follow this
specification. Platform behaviour referenced in comments (auto-recentering, prediction) is read
from AOSP `SpatializerPoseController.cpp` / `HeadTrackingProcessor.cpp`.

## starman-tech/mousepods

https://github.com/starman-tech/mousepods

Independent documentation of the 58-byte DEVMOTION6 payload (attitude quaternion, gyro and
gravity fields, gyro scale). Used to cross-check our own measurements; no code was copied.

## FIocker/aap-head-tracker (GPL-3.0-only)

https://github.com/FIocker/aap-head-tracker

Source of the AirPods Max 2 protocol facts: devmotion6 is a dynamically assigned RTBuddy service
(ID 6 on firmware 8E258), how a motion report is recognised, and which sensor axes are yaw, pitch
and roll. Reimplemented from those facts; no code was copied.

## Shizuku (Apache-2.0)

https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku

Used to run the privileged UserService with shell identity (no root).

## LibrePods and contributors (GPL-3.0-or-later)

AACP transport, the AirPods sensor stream (opcode 0x17) and the RTBuddy packet handling are
LibrePods' own work. Issues #719 and #713 and PR #617 and #887 were used as references for the
data layout and the system-spatializer route.
